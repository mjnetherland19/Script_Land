Here you can find examples of my code.

chloroplast_assembly_pipeline: a bash script that outlines the methods of assembling a draft chloroplast genome

cleanCript: a bash script that cleans and assembles RNA-seq reads. 

getClient.py: Test script to access the client list from a local Senaite install

getInParalogsNuc.py: Identifies the presence of out-paralog sequences from Newick phylogenetic trees

importSamples.py: A simple GUI that allows the user to pick the Client and Contact and imports their sample data from and Excel file into Senaite

reorganizeGenome.py: Finds a locus given a .bed file and removes the nucleotides preceding the locus and appends them to the bottom of the genome. I should think this is suitable for chromosomes as well. It was used on chloroplast genomes, hence the name.
